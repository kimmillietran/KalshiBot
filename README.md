# Kalshi BTC Edge

AI-powered trading assistant for Kalshi BTC markets. Built in milestones.

**Current:** Live BTC/Kalshi feeds (4.6B) + full trading engine through settings UI (5.0–5.11B) + historical data layer (6.1A–6.3B). `src/lib/data/` defines Bronze/Silver schemas; `InMemoryBronzeStore` provides append-only bronze storage; `KalshiHistoricalHttpAdapter` maps live Kalshi payloads to bronze; `SilverNormalizer` converts bronze to validated Silver records; `assembleHistoricalTradingSnapshot()` builds immutable replay-ready snapshots from Silver envelopes. Dashboard copies raw `TradeDecision` JSON via Engine Reasoning panel. Replay engine, filesystem persistence, and trade execution deferred.

## Engineering Standards

All future work — human or Agent — follows permanent project governance:

- **[Engineering Standards](docs/engineering-standards.md)** — architecture, testing, roadmap, definition of done, workflow
- **[Cursor Rules](.cursor/rules/)** — automatic Agent guidance (`architecture.mdc`, `testing.mdc`, `roadmap.mdc`)

Cursor loads these rules on every Agent run (`alwaysApply: true`). No need to paste instructions each session.

## Git workflow

Milestone development uses feature branches, review, merge to `main`, and milestone tags. See **[Git Workflow](docs/git-workflow.md)** for the full process.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + React 19
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- Vitest + React Testing Library
- Dark theme by default

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the trading dashboard renders at `/`.

```bash
npm run build    # production build
npm run lint     # eslint
npm run test     # vitest
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

On Windows PowerShell, `npm run <script> -- --flag value` may strip `--flag` tokens before they reach the script. Pipeline CLIs normalize argv at entry so both flag-style npm invocations and direct positional `tsx` usage work. See `scripts/lib/normalizeNpmArgv.ts`.

### Historical market discovery

```bash
npm run discover:markets -- --series KXBTC15M --output discovery-result.json

npm run discover:markets -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 50

npm run discover:markets -- \
  --series KXBTC15M \
  --after 2026-01-01 \
  --before 2026-02-01 \
  --limit 100

npm run discover:markets -- \
  --series KXBTC15M \
  --offset 500 \
  --limit 250

# Safe 50-market smoke test with throttling/backoff
npm run discover:markets -- \
  --series KXBTC15M \
  --limit 50 \
  --request-delay-ms 500 \
  --max-retries 5 \
  --retry-base-delay-ms 1000 \
  --output discovery-result.json
```

Default output: `discovery-result.json` (override with `--output`). Progress logs stream to stderr (`[discover] ...`); stdout remains JSON summary.

### Official research pipeline

```bash
npm run research:pipeline -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 500

# Smaller smoke run
npm run research:pipeline -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 100

# Continue after step failures (overall status becomes partial)
npm run research:pipeline -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 100 --continue-on-error
```

Writes `data/research-results/pipeline-summary.json` with per-step commands, exit codes, durations, and import throttle settings (`config.importThrottle`). Default is fail-fast.

Batch import uses **adaptive throttling** by default (`--adaptive-throttle`, 100–3000 ms). Override with fixed delay:

```bash
npm run research:pipeline -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 500 --request-delay-ms 1000
npm run research:pipeline -- --series KXBTC15M --limit 500 --no-adaptive-throttle
```

Long-running **batch import** and **strategy sweep** steps stream live progress to stderr (`[Import]` / `[Sweep]` blocks with bar, ETA, and counters). Stdout remains machine-readable JSON summaries.

### Smoke-test debugging

Runner-format `research-output.json` files double-encode `dataset` and `researchRun`, and fills live under `backtestResult.strategyRun.steps` — not at the top level. Use the inspect CLI instead of ad hoc PowerShell property access:

```bash
# Single run
npm run research:inspect -- --input data/research-results/buy-first-ask/KXBTC15M/KXBTC15M-26APR301900-00/research-output.json

# Scan a strategy folder
npm run research:inspect -- --input-dir data/research-results --strategy buy-first-ask --limit 5
```

Stdout is compact JSON with `strategyId`, PnL, fill/rejection counts, replay step count, diagnostics warnings, and `decisionTracePath` when available.

### Hypothesis evidence report

`npm run research:hypotheses` writes `data/research-results/hypothesis-candidates.json` and a human-readable `data/reports/research-hypotheses.html` with per-hypothesis evidence cards (metrics, confidence summary, and example markets). The generator scans expanded mispricing atlas bucket combinations (probability × time, probability × moneyness, moneyness × time, volatility × moneyness, and volatility × probability × time when sample sizes permit), emits separate over/under confidence hypotheses per qualifying cell, and filters single-day-dominated buckets via `--min-unique-days` (default 2). Override paths with `--output` and `--html-output`.

### Research artifact index

Inspect the health of all canonical research outputs in one place:

```bash
npm run research:artifact-index
```

Writes `data/research-results/research-artifact-index.json` and `data/reports/research-artifact-index.html`. Each entry includes artifact name, path, generated timestamp, producing pipeline step, upstream/downstream dependencies, file size, and status (`present`, `stale`, or `missing`). This is read-only — it does not run or modify the research pipeline.

### Historical coverage expansion planner

Analyze current historical coverage and get prioritized import recommendations:

```bash
npm run research:coverage-plan
```

Writes `data/research-results/historical-coverage-plan.json` and `data/reports/historical-coverage-plan.html` with market counts, month coverage, missing months, volatility regime coverage, market-type/ticker pattern coverage, and recommended next import windows with priority scores. Read-only — does not run imports or modify importer/replay/research calculations.

### Research dashboard

```bash
npm run research:dashboard
```

Writes `data/reports/research-dashboard.html` — a read-only landing page with pipeline status, artifact health, hypothesis/strategy summaries, and research health from existing artifacts.

### Full research orchestrator

```bash
npm run research:full
```

Invokes existing research CLIs in order: data health → mispricing atlas → hypotheses → validation → synthesis → harness (with `--input data/research-results/strategy-synthesis-candidates.json`) → harness results → candidate registry → candidate promotions → artifact index → lifecycle → dashboard. Writes `data/research-results/full-research-summary.json` with per-step status, duration, outputs, warnings, and failures. Independent reporting steps still run when upstream analysis fails. When no synthesized strategies match harness filters, the harness step no-ops with an empty summary and a single warning. Use `--continue-on-error` to keep executing the core chain after step failures.

### Strategy harness

```bash
npm run research:harness -- --input data/research-results/strategy-synthesis-candidates.json
```

Evaluates promotion-eligible synthesized strategies (`experimental`, `candidate`) through the historical research pipeline. Rejected strategies are excluded by default; pass `--include-rejected` for research experiments. When no strategies match filters, the harness exits successfully with an empty summary and one warning.

### Expansion import config generator

```bash
npm run research:generate-expansion-import-config
npm run research:generate-expansion-import-config -- --write
```

Reads `historical-coverage-plan.json` (M9.1) and produces `historical-expansion-config.json` plus an HTML report. Dry-run by default; pass `--write` to persist outputs. Does not execute imports.

### Strategy synthesis

`npm run research:strategy-synthesis` reads `hypothesis-candidates.json` and `hypothesis-validation.json`, then writes `data/research-results/strategy-synthesis-candidates.json` with parameterized strategy specs (direction, entry conditions, promotion status). Read-only — does not execute or modify strategies.

### Harness results

`npm run research:harness-results` reads `strategy-synthesis-candidates.json` and M8.15B harness outputs under `data/research-results/harness/`, then writes `data/research-results/harness-results.json` and `data/reports/research-harness-results.html` with per-strategy PnL metrics and promotion recommendations. Reporting only — does not modify replay or baseline strategy results.

### Candidate promotions

`npm run research:candidate-promotions` reads hypothesis validation, strategy synthesis, harness results (with harness-summary fallback), and optional statistical significance, then writes `data/research-results/candidate-promotions.json` and `data/reports/research-candidate-promotions.html` with advisory promotion decisions (`rejected`, `exploratory`, `needs-more-data`, `candidate`, `production-watchlist`). Read-only — does not modify strategy execution, trading, leaderboard, or sweep behavior.

### Candidate registry

`npm run research:candidate-registry` merges hypothesis, validation, synthesis, and harness artifacts into `data/research-results/research-candidate-registry.json` and `data/reports/research-candidate-registry.html` with stable candidate IDs, status tracking, promotion history, and rejection reasons. Read-only append/update registry — does not modify replay, strategies, sweep, or hypothesis generation.

### Research experiment manager

```bash
npm run research:experiments
```

Snapshots the current research outputs as an immutable experiment under `data/research-results/experiments/<experimentId>/experiment.json`, updates `data/research-results/experiment-index.json` (latest pointer + history), and writes `data/reports/research-experiments.html` with deltas vs the previous experiment (hypothesis counts, robustness, promotions, candidates, runtime, artifact status). Read-only — does not modify replay, strategy execution, trading, or hypothesis calculations.
